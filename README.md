# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Dataset can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

This project aims to enhance credit card fraud detection by combining the power of autoencoders and machine learning classifiers. The dataset, containing credit card transactions, is preprocessed to extract meaningful features. An autoencoder is trained on resampled data to create a latent representation that captures underlying patterns. This representation is then used to train classifiers. The project explores the impact of autoencoder-encoded data on classifier performance, with special focus on linear and non-linear classifiers. The goal is to achieve superior fraud detection accuracy through a fusion of autoencoder-based feature extraction and classifier prediction.
